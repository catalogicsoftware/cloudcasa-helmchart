--------Please be patient while the chart is being deployed--------

Tip: Watch the App deployment status using the command: kubectl/oc get pods -n cloudcasa-io

Monitor the Cloudcasa UI, the regsitered cluster state should be moved to Ready State. If the clutser is still in Pending state, wrong ClusterID would have been provided.
